# This Site

This site is basically just a blog.  I registered the domain name long
ago as a bit of a lark but, as someone who detests slow computers
(which usually is caused by I/O of some kind), I find it to be a
fitting place to type into.

# Me
My name is Chip.  I am:

* An opinionated troublemaker;
* a former Engineer at Facebook and Google;
* and a self-proclaimed reasonably technical people manager.

I work scaling, reliability, distributed systems, etc.
